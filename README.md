# Wallets
Wallets is a multi-coin wallet designed for cold storage with built-in 
encryption.

**Important Note**: This is not production-ready, and by using this software you realize that the authors/owners and maintainers are not responsible for any money loss, misusage etc. etc. etc. and you are fully responsible of your own actions and decisions. **TL;DR**: So do not use if you don't know what you are doing. Read the code. You are fully responsible of your own stuff... and don't sue us if you lose money.

The main features are:

 * Simple to use via CLI
 * Encrypted with AES-256
 * Support for multiple coins
 * Designed for cold storage / Offline Wallets [WIP]
